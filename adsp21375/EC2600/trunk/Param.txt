		001) Link ON = The parameters are always same for both channels 1 and 2.
	When the GEQ is linked using the GEQ Link parameter, all the GEQ parameter on both channels
	are kept in the same status. Changes made to the parameters of one channel automatically
	cause the same changes in the other channel.
	GEQ Link setting affects GEQ parameters, GEQ OnOff and GEQ level. When the link is switched
	from OFF to ON, the parameter values of the channel specified using the channel select byte
	is copied to the other. In this case,the parameter values are overwritten. The original
	values cannot be restored even if the link is switched back to OFF. When the link is switched
	from ON to OFF, the channel select byte has nothing to do, so select 0 (as dummy data).

	When the PEQ Link Parameter is ON, all the PEQ on both channels are kept in the same status.
	Changes made to the parameters of one channel automatically cause the same changes in the
	other channel.
	PEQ Link settings affect PEQ parameters, PEQ OnOff and PEQ level. When the link condition
	is switched from OFF to ON, the parameter values of the link master channel (specified with
	the use of the channel select function) are copied to the other, and the parameter values
	are overwritten. The original values cannot be restored even if the link is switched back to
	OFF. When the link is switched from ON to OFF, the channel select byte has nothing to do, so

		Low-shelving:  012 (37.5Hz) - 121 (20kHz)
	When 0 (OFF) is selected for the Type Parameter, setting the frequency only results in a
	command error.	Signal processing on channels 1 and 2 is performed independently.
	Select 1 for CH byte to set the parameters for channel 1. Similarly, select 2 for channel 2.
	Selecting 0 provides the same parameters for channels 1 and 2, but in this case the Type

	When the link mode is 0 (INDIVIDUAL), both compressors must be turned on or off individually.
	When the link mode 1 (LINK STEREO) or 2 (LINK IN-1) is selected, turning on or off the
	channel 1 simultaneously controls the channel 2. When the link mode 3 (LINK IN-2) is
	selected, turning on or off the channel 2 simultaneously controls the channel 1.

032:Comp Attack(11BYTES)				(ID$032CVVV
	Used for level detection, the Comp Attack Parameter determines the compressor response speed
	to increasing signal level. Naturally, the shorter the attack time, the faster the response.
	Usable parameter values range from 000 (0.01msec) to 060 (1000msec).
	The signal level is detected independently for channels 1 and 2, making it possible to set
	the parameters also independently for each channel. Select 1 for CH byte to set the
	parameters for channel 1. Similarly, select 2 for channel 2. Selecting 0 sets the same
	parmeters for both channels.
	However, the channel in use for setting must be specified by CH byte according to the Comp
	Link Mode setting. Otherwise, the changes will not be reflected on the sound.

033:Comp Release(11BYTES)				(ID$033CVVV
	The Comp Release Parameter is also related to level detection and used to determine the
	compressor response speed to decreasing signal level. Naturally, the shorter the release

	Allows adjustment of the signal level for activating gain reduction.
	Usable parameter values are 000 (0.0dBFS) to 096 (-48.0dBFS).
	The actual level is expressed by -0.5*(parameter value) [dBFS].
		Note) [dBFS] represents the decibel level in the digital domain expressed in
		proportion to the full scale level of the A/D and D/A converters.
	The channel in use for setting must be specified by CH byte according to the Comp Link Mode
	setting. Otherwise, the changes will not be reflected on the sound.

035:Comp Ratio(11BYTES)					(ID$035CVVV
	Allows adjustment of the ratio for the gain reduction for the signal exceeding the
	threshold level. (The greater the ratio, the greater the gain reduction.)
	Usable parameter values are 000 (1:1) to 100 ( ¡Þ:1).
	The ratio is calculated by the following equation:
		1/(1-(parameter value)/100):1
	Note) When the ratio is set at 1:1, no reduction occurs regardless of threshold and other
	settings. The channel in use for setting must be specified by CH byte according to the
	Comp Link Mode setting. Otherwise, the changes will not be reflected on the sound.

036:Comp Gain(11BYTES)					(ID$036CVVV
	To control the level after it has been compressed.
	Up to +30dB gain make-up is possible.
	Usable parameter values are 000 (-¡ÞdB) to 241 (30.0dB).
					0 = -¡ÞdB (muted)
				1-241 = -90.0 + 0.5*(parameter value) dB
	Unless INDIVIDUAL is selected for the Comp Link, both channels provide exactly the same
	gain make-up, changes made to the parameters of one channel automatically cause the same
	changes in the other channel.

	Used to set the center frequency or turnover frequency of the side equalizer. When it is
	necessary to change the frequency only, the command is sent using this index.

030:Compressor SideEQ Level(11BYTES)	(ID$030CVVV

031:Compressor SideEQ Q(11BYTES)		(ID$031CVVV

038:Master Delay(14BYTES)				(ID$038CVVVVVV
	To set the delay time for two master channels.
	The delay time is expressed by the number of samplings(words).
	The adjustable range is 0 to 131071[samplings].
	The built-in sampling frequency is 96kHz. This means that the sampling period is equivalent
	to approx. 10.4 microseconds.

	Basically, the final amount of delay is computed by adding the master delay time to the
	channel delay time. When MIX is selected for the CH Source Parameter, however, the master
	delay time is not added and the channel delay time becomes the final delay time.

054:CH Link(22BYTES)			(ID$054VVV VVV VVV VVV VVV
					        A   B   C   D   E
	To specify how to link the output channels.
	The linked channels operate in exactly the same condition.
	Changes made to one of the linked channel's parameters are immediately reflected on other.
	The CH Link Parameter uses 1 byte per each channel to represent the link status of the six
	output channels. The first 2 bits are dummy bits. The rest bits correspond to OUT-A to OUT-F
	(from 3rd to 8th, one bit for each channel).
	Linked channels are indicated by "1". Non-linked channels are indicated by "0".
	ex 1) When all channels are independent
		CH Link of OUT-A = 0x20 = 00100000
		CH Link of OUT-B = 0x10 = 00010000
		CH Link of OUT-C = 0x08 = 00001000
		CH Link of OUT-D = 0x04 = 00000100
		CH Link of OUT-E = 0x02 = 00000010
		CH Link of OUT-F = 0x01 = 00000001
	ex 2) When linking OUT-A with D, B with E, and C with F after assigning OUT-A, B and C to
		the low, mid and high ranges of CH-1 of a 3-way stereo speaker system and OUT-D,
		E and F to the same of CH-2.
		CH Link of OUT-A = 0x24 = 00100100
	 	CH Link of OUT-B = 0x12 = 00010010
		CH Link of OUT-C = 0x09 = 00001001
		CH Link of OUT-D = 0x24 = 00100100
		CH Link of OUT-E = 0x12 = 00010010
		CH Link of OUT-F = 0x09 = 00001001

	The status of OUT-F is automatically determined if the CH Link Parameter for OUT-A through
	OUT-E are specified. That's why the CH Link Command contains the values for OUT-A to OUT-E
	only. The values are specified in the form of ASCII decimal data.
	As explained, the parameter value of linked channels is bound to be the same.When different
	values are detected, the SRP-F300 performs automatic correction. The value of the channel
	with lower priority is considered incorrect and replaced by the value of the channel with
	higher priority. (OUT-A has the highest channel priority, with OUT-E the lowest.)

040:CH Source(11BYTES)					(ID040CVVV
	To select the sound source signal from the two master channel signals.
		000) Mixed signal (channel 1 and 2 signals equally mixed)
		001) Channel 1 signal
		002) Channel 2 signal
	In the position of the CH byte, write 0 to 5 instead of A to F.
	Note 1) The master delay setting has no effect when 0 (mixed signal) is
	selected. Delay time depends solely on the channel delay setting.
	Using the channel link function, the same CH Source Parameter value can be
	set for multiple channels.

041:Crossover LCF Type(11BYTES)			(ID041CVVV
	To select the type (order and roll-off characteristics) of the low-cut filter.
		000) Butterworth, 2nd order (-12dB/oct)
		001) Butterworth, 3rd order (-18dB/oct)
		......
		008) Bessel, 5th order (-30dB/oct)
		009) Bessel, 6th order (-36dB/oct)
		010) Linkwitz-Riley, 2nd order (-12dB/oct)
		011) Linkwitz-Riley, 4th order (-24dB/oct)
	In the position of the CH byte, write 0 to 5 instead of A to F.
	Symmetric frequency control can be achieved by selecting the same type for
	both low-cut and high-cut filters.
	To deactivate the filter, select 000 (OFF) for the LCF Freq Parameter. Using the channel
	link function, the same LCF Type parameter can be set for multiple channels.

042:Crossover LCF Freq(11BYTES)			(ID042CVVV
	To set the cut-off frequency of the low-cut filter.
	Usable parameter values are 000 (OFF) and 001 (20Hz) to 121 (20kHz).
	Butterworth and Bessel type filters provide a 3dB cut at the cut-off frequency. With the
	Linkwitz-Riley type filters, this is doubled to 6dB.

044:Crossover HCF Freq(11BYTES)			(ID044CVVV
045:CH PEQ Type(22BYTES)				(ID045CBBTTTFFFLLLQQQ
	In the position of the CH byte, write 0 to 5 instead of A to F.
	The three bands must be described as 00, 01 or 02.

	Usable parameter values are 000 (-¡ÞdB) to 205 (12.0dB).

050:Peak Limiter Threshold
	To set the peak limiter threshold level for each channel.
	Usable parameter values are 000 (OFF) to 053 (-20.0dBFS).

		001-053) 6.0 - 0.5*(parameter value - 1) dB
	In the position of the CH byte, write 0 to 5 instead of A to F.
	Note) dBFS represents the decibel level in the digital domain expressed in proportion to
	the full scale level (clipping level) of the A/D and D/A converters. Due to the ample
	headroom secured above the full scale level of the A/D and D/A converters, the threshold
	can be set even at a level above 0.0dBSF.

051:CH Delay(14BYTES)					(ID$051CVVVVVV
